FFD & BFD


A feasible packing is an assignment of elements to bins such
that the sum of the elements in each bin is not greater than C.
Any feasible packing of S provides an upper bound. Firstfit
decreasing (FFD) and best-fit decreasing (BFD) [Johnson,
1973] are classic approximation algorithms for bin packing.
For both, we sort the elements of S in decreasing order and
consider the items one at a time. For FFD, each element
is placed into the first bin it fits into. For BFD, each element
is placed into the most full bin it fits into. Consider
S={15,10,6,4,3,2} and C=20. The FFD and BFD solutions
are [{15, 4}, {10, 6, 3}, {2}] and [{15, 3, 2}, {10, 6, 4}].
